Attack/Flee

I figured if there is a badass dragon close by, the ship should run away regardless of what it is doing.

So essentially while the ship is attacking, if the dragon appears, it flees, once it is safe again, the ship goes into wander.
If the ship is seeking, if the dragon appears, it will again flee until it is safe then go into wander.

Basically, all states can go into flee, but flee can only change into wander.
